Grid Paths
This C++ program seems to implement a dynamic programming algorithm to count the number of paths from the top-left corner of a grid to the bottom-right corner, with the constraint that you can only move right or down, and some cells in the grid are blocked by '*'

Input: The program reads an integer n representing the size of the grid, followed by n strings each representing a row of the grid.

Initialization:

dp is initialized as a 2D vector of size (n+1) x (n+1) with all values initially set to 0.
The modulo value mod is set to 1e9 + 7.
The base case dp[0][0] is set to 1, representing the start position.
Dynamic Programming:

For each cell in the grid, the program iterates through each row and each column.
If the cell is not blocked ('*'), it updates the count of paths to reach that cell based on the counts from the cell above and the cell to the left.
If the cell is blocked, the count for that cell is set to 0.
Output: The program prints the number of paths to reach the bottom-right corner (dp[n-1][n-1]), modulo 1e9 + 7. If n is 0 (meaning no grid is given), it prints -1.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the size of the grid. It is essentially a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to solve the problem of counting paths in a grid with obstacles.
Dice Combinations
Include Libraries: The code includes the necessary libraries (<bits/stdc++.h> and <iostream>) for standard input-output and standard template libraries.

Typedef Declaration: It defines ll as long long for convenience.

Macro Definitions: Defines MAXN as the maximum value of n and MOD as the modulus value.

Global Variables: Declares global variables DP (an array) and n to store the dynamic programming array and the input value, respectively.

Function compute: This function computes the number of ways to reach a sum of left using dynamic programming. It recursively computes the number of ways by considering all possible outcomes of rolling a fair six-sided die. If the value of DP[left] is already computed (not equal to 0), it returns that value. Otherwise, it iterates through all possible outcomes of a die roll (from 1 to 6), subtracts each outcome from the current left, and recursively calls compute for the new value. It stores the result in DP[left] and returns it.

Main Function: Reads input value n, initializes the DP array with 0s except for DP[0] which is initialized to 1 (there is one way to reach a sum of 0), calls the compute function with n, and prints the result.

Overall, this algorithm effectively uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to reach a given sum n using a fair six-sided die.
